# Fuzzy Britches Repository
This repository is primarily for the development of PSMC/Kodi addons forked, modified, created, designed or hosted by "The Papaw".
All items hosted here are for learning and educational purposes only. They include:

• <B>Fuzzy Britches</B> (Exodus type)<BR>
• <B>Kids Cove</B> (Jen based)<BR>
• <B>PSMC Maintenance</B> (Maintenance Program)<BR>
• <B>Various Skins - see below</B> (Usually forked from the Aeon-nox Sylvo v7.0.1 skin)<BR>

• The Fuzzy Britches addon has been ported and patched together from various other Exodus type addons, including Covenant, Incursion, Numbers. Please give credit to their respective developers. <B>Make sure to read NEWS section for best results!</B>

• The Kids Cove addon is a Jen type addon just for kids and include tons of old and new cartoons, anime and many old TV classic shows. Again, please give credit the JEN developers.

• PSMC Maintenance Tools - Features include: Auto delete of cache at start up (optional), notifies when packages and thumbs reach a set amount of wasted storage space (you can set and change sizes), cuts down on your devices read/writes on the ROM. Also has many Backup/Restore Options, Speed test, IP check and other features. Again, please give credit to their respective developers.

These addons have been tested with Kodi v18.2 and appear to be working fine unless otherwise stated.

The SKINS here were themed and/or modded for using with PSMC 18. They work with Kodi 18 as well. All were themed from Aeon Nox SiLVO (v7.0.1) unless otherwise stated. They include:

• <B>PSMC's Silvo Skin</B> - General Aeon Nox SiLVO skin themed for PSMC/Kodi 18<BR>
• <B>PSMC's Spiderman</B> - Spiderman Theme modded and brought up-to-date for PSMC/Kodi 18<BR>
• <B>PSMC's Man of Steel</B> - Man of Steel Theme modded and brought up-to-date for PSMC/Kodi 18<BR>
• <B>PSMC's Super Mario Galaxy</B> - Super Mario Galaxy Theme modded and brought up-to-date for PSMC/Kodi 18 (If you wish to use the included <B>MARIO GUI SOUNDS</B>, you need to enable them in the system settings!)

These addons are 3rd party addons, so please do not seek help from Kodi, the Kodi forums, etc..
